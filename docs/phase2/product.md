# Technical Product Report

## Proposed Features

For Phase 2, we plan on implementing the following use-cases:

### Create Response

> As a form filler, I want to be able to create a new response for an SDCForm for a particular patient with default values filled in

### Create New Form

> As a form manager, I want to be able to add a new SDCForm to the system and associate it with a DiagnosticProcedureID so that form fillers can use the new form to collect data for that procedure

### View Response

> As a form filler, I want to generate a unique, persistent URL to the form response so that I can share the link with others

> As a form receiver, I want to be able to view a persistent page with a form response so that I can review the results to make a prognosis

## What We Actually Built

- **TODO:** What did you actually build during this phase?
  - How is this different from what you originally proposed? Why?

## High-level design

- **TODO:** High-level design of your software.

## Technical Highlights

- **TODO:** Technical highlights: interesting bugs, challenges, lessons learned, observations, etc.

## Reflection

- **TODO:** Reflect on your teamwork and process. What worked well, what needs improvement.
  - Ideally you will have specific artifacts from your development process to show (for instance, a burndown chart)

## Next Phase

- **TODO:** Triage: What will you build for phase 3, the final demo?
